# OMEGA-AI : User Research
### Qualitative Research on Neurodiverse Cognitive Needs

**Project:** OMEGA-AI — Local Exocortex for Neurodiverse Minds  
**Researcher:** Chems Omari  
**Method:** Semi-structured qualitative interviews  
**Period:** February 2026 (ongoing)  
**Status:** In progress — target 10 participants

---

## Methodology

### Approach
Qualitative user research conducted through semi-structured interviews with neurodiverse individuals (ADHD, autism/ASD, giftedness/HPI).

### Goal
Understand specific cognitive needs, pain points, and tool expectations to inform the development of specialized OMEGA-AI modules.

### Ethics
- Participants informed of research purpose
- Data anonymized for publication
- No commercial use of data
- Participation voluntary

## Participant #1 — "Theo"

**Profile**
- Age: 28
- Employment: Interim work
- Education: Scientific Baccalaureate (MP track) + Preparatory classes
- Diagnosis: ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) — mild, diagnosed 2 years ago

**Identified Difficulties**

*Communication*
- Perceived as "too direct" in social situations
- Difficulty modulating message delivery ("you can't say that")
- Social perception blockages — message often misunderstood

*Emotional & Social Reception*
- Difficulty understanding others' emotions and reactions
- Struggles to infer what others are thinking
- Issues with both receiving and expressing emotional content

*Motivation*
- Uncertainty whether low motivation is trait-based or disorder-related

**Expressed Needs**
- Understanding social interactions (primary need)
- Decoding what others feel and think
- Being understood by others (secondary)
- A verbalization partner — tool to externalize and process daily events
- Cognitive prosthesis for reflection and communication support

**Tool Orientation**
> "A comprehension tool, a thought partner for verbalization, understanding, and reflection — a cognitive prosthesis."

**Perceived Suffering:** 3/10 (scale 1–7)

**Personal Philosophy**
> "Not a handicap — the goal is to live *with* others, not to *become* like others."

**Outcome**
Participant expressed genuine interest in testing OMEGA-AI once functional:
> "When your thing works, I'd like to try it — I really need it."

## Participant #2 — "Alex"

**Profile**
- Age: 44
- Employment: Unemployed
- Education: Last attended: 3rd grade (collège)
- Diagnosis: ADHD without hyperactivity (self-diagnosed, confirmed via psychiatric questionnaire)
- Notable: 20 months cannabis-free (former daily user — zero perceived benefit from use)

**Identified Difficulties**

*Attention & Focus*
- Random focus — cannot sustain attention voluntarily
- Constant mental wandering and spiraling
- Extreme difficulty re-centering
- Feels "out of focus" almost permanently

*Mental Fog*
- Persistent sensation of a slow, confused, "foggy" mind
- Thoughts unclear and difficult to organize
- No experience of mental clarity in a long time

*Memory*
- Short-term memory disrupted ("listens halfway, retains halfway")
- Difficulty keeping information active in working memory
- Does not lose keys — but loses threads of conversations and instructions

*Procrastination*
- Extreme — cannot initiate even simple tasks
- Mental paralysis when facing obligations
- Sensation of "cognitive lethargy"

*Executive Function*
- Cannot maintain any planning system or organizational tool
- All tools tested have been abandoned
- Overwhelmed by even simple prioritization

*Emotional Regulation*
- Emotions strongly impact concentration capacity
- Constant rumination and intrusive thoughts
- Cognitive saturation

*Motivation*
- Very low — everything feels like extreme effort
- Knows he is capable but can no longer produce
- Feels stuck in deep inertia

*Sleep (15+ years)*
- 5 to 7 hours only
- Multiple nightly wake-ups
- Never feels rested upon waking
- Chronic fatigue affecting attention and emotional regulation

*Lifestyle Factors*
- Regular caffeine, high sugar intake
- Frequent screen use (morning/evening)
- ~70% processed food diet
- Electronic cigarette

**Participant's Own Summary (prepared with AI assistance)**
> "Cognitive saturation, attention dysregulation, profound mental fatigue, loss of mental endurance, low dopaminergic activation, emotional overload, loss of executive capacity."

> "Nothing indicates irreversible loss. Everything is compatible with cognitive exhaustion + ADHD dysregulation + disrupted lifestyle — reversible with a progressive program."

**Social**
- Reduced social interactions
- Increasingly difficulty engaging with people he perceives as intellectually unstimulating
- More comfortable with highly intelligent individuals
- Decreasing social masking
- No depression reported

**Expressed Needs**
- Mental calm and peace — reducing cognitive noise
- A tool to quiet thoughts (mentioned meditation interest)
- External structure to compensate for absent internal structure

**Tool Orientation**
Needs a tool that can:
- Provide calm and structure when internal regulation fails
- Reduce cognitive load by externalizing memory and planning
- Function as a consistent, non-judgmental cognitive anchor

**Perceived Suffering:** High (implicit — charge mentale 10/10 self-reported)

**Key Tension**
Expressed desire to be *treated/cured* rather than *supported as-is* — reflects deeper suffering and identity conflict around neurodiversity.

## Emerging Patterns

### Shared Across Both Participants
- Desire for external cognitive support (both describe a "prosthesis" or "anchor")
- Difficulty with standard tools — abandoned quickly or never adopted
- Awareness of their own profile — both articulate and self-reflective
- Preference for tools that adapt to them, not tools that "normalize" them

### Divergence
| Dimension | Theo (ASD) | Alex (ADHD) |
|---|---|---|
| Primary pain | Social comprehension | Attention & executive function |
| Suffering level | Low-moderate (3/10) | High (10/10) |
| Identity stance | Accept self, navigate world | Wants to change, be "fixed" |
| Tool need | Verbalization partner | Calm & structure provider |
| Social profile | Functional, employed | Isolated, unemployed |

## Design Implications for OMEGA-AI

### Module: ASD Support
- **Social Context Decoder** — help interpret ambiguous social situations
- **Verbalization Assistant** — guided externalization of daily events and emotions
- **Communication Advisor** — help formulate messages with appropriate tone
- **Emotion Mapper** — help identify and name what others may be feeling

### Module: ADHD Support
- **Cognitive Calm Layer** — reduce mental noise, provide structured grounding
- **Working Memory Extension** — retain context and threads across session
- **Task Activation Support** — micro-step initiation for procrastination paralysis
- **Attention Anchor** — gentle refocusing without judgment

### Shared Architecture Requirement
The CT/MT/LT memory system with Heat Score is validated as essential:
- Continuity across sessions (critical for both profiles)
- No repetition required from user (reduces friction)
- Adaptive context = reduced cognitive load

## Next Steps

- [ ] Recruit 5–8 additional participants (target: 3 ASD, 3 ADHD, 2–3 HPI/gifted)
- [ ] Conduct interviews using refined semi-structured protocol
- [ ] Identify HPI-specific patterns (overload, arborescent thinking, boredom)
- [ ] Begin beta-testing with willing participants (Theo confirmed interest)
- [ ] Contact neuropsychology researchers (LPNC / GIN Grenoble) for academic validation
- [ ] Publish anonymized synthesis as research contribution

 👤 Participant Profile #3: Fabian

Age: 30

Occupation: IT (Technical Support)

Education: Bachelor’s degree (Tech)

Diagnosis: ADHD (diagnosed at age 11)

Perceived distress: 4 / 10 (Moderate) ( max 8 for hours, min 4 )

🧠 Identified Challenges

The attention paradox: Alternates between hyperfocus and a complete inability to concentrate on learning topics (e.g., programming).

The “ignition” problem: Major difficulty initiating tasks (initial motivation barrier).

Sustaining effort: Difficulty maintaining focus and consistency over time once started.

Social: Unlike Théo, he does not report any particular social difficulties.

🛠️ Strategies and Needs

Current tools: Uses physical Post-its everywhere (on his screen, around his environment), but this already requires attention effort to check them.

Motivation levers: Music acts as a focus and motivation regulator.

Expressed needs:

A “thinking partner” to help him get started and stay focused.

A reminder system or a “psychological companion” that challenges the user.

A “cognitive prosthesis” for task initiation (starting) and continuity.

💡 Personal Philosophy

Kaizen (Continuous Improvement): “Trying to be better every day.” He values small, consistent progress.
