📅 January 10, 2026: The "Day Zero" Devlog

Status: First raw test of the organic memory engine.

    "It works, but it's slow... really slow. I think I've hit a wall with memory layer saturation. Data flows from Short-Term to Middle-Term, but the embedding to Long-Term is creating a massive bottleneck on this hardware."

The Reality Check: This video isn't about a success; it's about a diagnostic. I'm sitting in front of a basic terminal on a budget laptop, realizing that my initial memory compression logic was too heavy. There’s no UI, no "polished" code—just a developer trying to understand why his system is suffocating.

What I learned that day: Failure is the best teacher. This "bug" forced me to rethink how ΩMEGA should handle data pruning and heat scores. It was the moment I stopped guessing and started measuring.

“When it fails, that's when you learn.”
