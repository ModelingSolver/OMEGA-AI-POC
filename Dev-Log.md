📅 Jan 10, 2026: Saturation Diagnostic 
Link: https://youtu.be/JtOW6oLL2MU

    "It works but it’s super slow... ok great... looks like a bug... maybe one of the memory layers is saturating. I think the whole deal is gonna be that... Yeah, that’s it, the layer was saturating. It should embed from MT to LT too... but everything is slow, everything is slow... WOOO, that’s not a good summary! Okay! Gotta change everything, gotta change everything... (whistling). I'm singing, when it doesn't work, that's when you learn, right? Well, that's what you gotta tell yourself... In my pov terminal... Yeah, I didn't make a pretty interface, or even an interface at all yet. Ok, I get it, it's memory layer saturation. Ok, we're gonna fix this!"

The Reality: No fluff, no UI. Just the engine choking on a budget laptop. This is the exact moment I realized the bottleneck was the management of the ST/MT/LT layers. It’s slow, it’s raw, but the diagnostic is done.
