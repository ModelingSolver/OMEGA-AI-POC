1. Abstract

Current Language Models suffer from episodic amnesia, which restricts the potential for co-emergence between the user and the system. This paper introduces ΩMEGA AI, an architecture born from a naturalist approach aimed at resolving this technical limitation through a stratified memory structure. Although developed autonomously through conceptual modeling, this architecture converges with classical models of cognitive psychology while surpassing them through the implementation of dynamic sedimentation and synaptic pruning processes.


2. Introduction: Genesis of a Naive Observation

The ΩMEGA AI project is based on direct observation of human cognitive functioning when faced with the rigidity of classical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. The initial intuition was to create a "living" memory capable of prioritizing information based on its importance and recurrence, rather than a simple cumulative storage.


3. Architecture: Convergence Toward Stratification

The ΩMEGA architecture implements three distinct layers born from a necessity for performance optimization:

    Short-Term (ST) / Working Memory: Management of the immediate flow (last 6 messages).

    Medium-Term (MT) / Consolidation Zone: Recent summaries with a Dynamic Heat Score.

    Long-Term (LT) / Deep Archive: Permanent storage with cosine similarity search.

This segmentation, although derived through engineering, corresponds to cognitive psychology observations regarding the structure of human memory.
4. Dynamic Sedimentation Mechanism (Heat Score)

The core of ΩMEGA is the Dynamic Heat Score. It simulates the biological processes of information survival:

    Potentiation (LTP): Information gains importance (+0.5 to +1) based on its contextual relevance.

    Depression / Pruning (LTD): "Cold" information undergoes natural forgetting (synaptic pruning) to free up computational power.


5. Therapeutic Application and Neurodiversity

ΩMEGA is designed as an exocortex for neurodivergent minds (ADHD, Giftedness/HPI, ASD). By externalizing working memory, the system acts as a cognitive prosthesis that compensates for executive limitations through an adaptive support structure.
