🚀 What Now? / Current Roadmap

This document tracks the immediate evolution of ΩMEGA AI as it moves from a functional prototype to a research-grade cognitive exocortex.
1. The "Linux Migration" & Power Upgrade 🐧

Current Windows overhead (consuming ~8GB RAM) limits the deployment of advanced models.

    Action: Migration to a dedicated Linux environment (Dual Boot).

    Goal: Freeing resources to swap Phi-3 with Mistral-Nemo (12B) or Llama 3.1 (8B).

    Impact: Higher reasoning quality for the "Greffier" (summarization) and better nuance in French/slang for the user.

2. Refining the "Heat Score" (LTP/LTD) 🧠

The current mechanism is functional but requires empirical fine-tuning.

    Action: Testing the 0.35 similarity threshold in real-world long-duration sessions.

    Action: Implementing Temporal Decay. Just like biological memory, a "hot" memory that isn't accessed for 48 hours should lose heat naturally.

    Action: Formalizing the "Immortalization" threshold (Heat > 2).

3. Empirical Research & Human Feedback 🔬

Moving from code to humans.

    Action: Internal testing with "cobayes" (beta-testers) from the neurodivergent community (ADHD, ASD, Giftedness).

    Data Collection: Observing how ΩMEGA handles "executive function gaps" (e.g., remembering a task mentioned 3 hours ago or a mood shift).

    Academic Bridge: Reaching out to neuro-psychology researchers (LPNC/GIN Grenoble) to validate the architecture's impact on cognitive load.

4. Visualization & UI (The "Mirror" Effect) 🖥️

A terminal is good, but a "Cognitive Mirror" needs a face.

    Action: Developing a Streamlit/Gradio interface.

    Feature: A "Memory Heatmap" allowing the user to see which memories are currently "hot" (MT) and which are "sinking" into the deep archive (LT).

5. NLNet Grant Objectives 🎯

This roadmap aligns with our commitment to:

    Digital Sovereignty: 100% local, no telemetry.

    Social Impact: Specific focus on cognitive accessibility and neuro-inclusion.

    Open Science: Documentation of the co-emergence process between atypical minds and stratified AI memory.
