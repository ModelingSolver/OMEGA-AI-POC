ΩMEGA AI: Organic-Like Stratified Memory for Local LLMs 🧠🌌
Postulate of Co-Emergence

Due to their architecture and structure, LLMs possess a certain plasticity and faculty for adapting to the user. This mutual adaptation between the user and the LLM allows for co-emergence.

However, current models—whether local or online—are "amnesic," which limits the quality of interaction and the "human-AI co-emergence".

The R&D postulate of ΩMEGA AI is as follows: An "efficient" memory would enable better interactional quality and enhanced user-LLM co-emergence. This is achieved without touching the LLM's weights or requiring internal recalibration, which would be energy-intensive and time-consuming locally (and impossible for non-local models).
The Genesis: Beyond Classic RAG

After testing classic "RAG" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) loops with archival, encyclopedia-like memory, their inefficiency became clear. The problems included:

    Accumulation and heaviness.

    Lack of agility or relevance in data processing.

    Power management issues (handling archival memory alongside a local LLM).

    Exponential processing power requirements.

Moving away from these "flat" systems, I naively reflected on human memory. Focusing on observable functioning rather than biological reality, I isolated a development axis: memory organized into three layers—ST, MT, and LT—where search effort is proportional to the depth of the data.
Examples of Natural Retrieval:

    My Name: Instant recovery (ST constant + LT instantaneous) without effort.

    Where are my keys?: ST scraps or clues + MT information; requires more effort but is close in time and recoverable.

    First day of school: MT recovery possible, but requires very high concentration and effort.

🏗️ The Stratified Memory Model

ΩMEGA AI shifts from a "flat hard drive" to a pyramidal structure where access speed is inversely proportional to depth.
1. Short-Term Layer (ST): Immediate Attention

    Function: The working "Buffer". It holds the latest exchanges, proper nouns mentioned two minutes ago, and current mood.

    Mechanism: Stored in RAM (very fast). No complex vector search here; it functions as "cache".

    Cost: Virtually zero.

2. Medium-Term Layer (MT): Contextual Consolidation

    Function: This is where plasticity resides. It contains themes from this morning's discussion or recent factual corrections provided by the user.

    Mechanism: The AI "reflects" here to find info using a lightweight vector index. Frequently called info stays here; otherwise, it "sediments".

    Cost: Moderate (local search).

3. Long-Term Layer (LT): The Deep Archive

    Function: Personal history, deep ethical values, and memories from 6 months ago.

    Mechanism: Compressed or disk-based storage (slower). The AI only searches here if upper layers fail or if the user signal is strong (e.g., "Do you remember what we said at the start of the project?").

    Cost: High (requires longer scan/reflection time).

🔄 The Organic Sedimentation Process

What makes ΩMEGA unique is the movement between these layers:

    LTP (Long-Term Potentiation): The more a subject is discussed, the more it rises toward ST/MT. The information "strengthens".

    LTD (Long-Term Depression): Unused information "sinks" toward LT or is eventually forgotten (synaptic pruning) to free up processing power.

Why this solves RAG limitations:

    Reduced Heaviness: We don't scan 10 GB of text for every sentence; we start with the 10 MB of the MT.

    Power Efficiency: Search is progressive. The CPU/GPU only ramps up if we "dig" for an old memory.

    Relevance: It prevents hallucinations caused by obsolete contexts polluting the current conversation.

🎯 The Vision: Atypie Helping & Sovereignty

The project is divided into two parts:

    Public Sovereignty: A local, sovereign alternative to large commercial models, ensuring data confinement and privacy.

    Therapeutic Tool: Support for "atypical brains" (HPI, ADHD, ASD...).

For a TDAH (ADHD) mind, the transition from ST to MT is often "leaky". ΩMEGA AI aims to plug these holes and adapt to atypical "thought paths".

Goal: Not to develop an omnipotent AGI, but to create functional, human-centered local tools that open new paths for research.
